				It all starts with the envelope.
			</p>

			<p class="junge font_big centred">
				Your envelope is the first thing your guests will see, and the first impression they will have of your big day.
			</p>

			<p>It should surprise, impress and delight them: make them feel excited to open it and find out what's inside.</p>

			<p>It shouldn't feel like a birthday card from Aunt Edith.</p>

			<p>And it shouldn't feel like an afterthought:</p>

			<p class="junge font_big centred">
				You wouldn't wrap a gift badly, so why settle for a dull, plain envelope?
			</p>

			<p>That's why our envelopes come as something of an unexpected surprise:</p>

			<p>Tailor-made by hand, and imprinted with your own monogram, each envelope is optionally adorned with a breathtaking foil seal and printed inside and out with a matching design that co-ordinates beautifully in the same colour as the invitation it contains.</p>

			<p>Each envelope comes individually addressed to your guests: and if you opt for our box-envelopes, your guests really will feel like they are opening an invitation to an important event. </p>

			<p class="junge font_big centred">
				Our highly bespoke envelopes lend an exclusivity to your wedding invitations that will have your guests wondering how you made them.
			</p>

			<p class="junge font_big centred">
				But the envelopes are just the beginning...

			You won't find anything like our exclusive envelopes: too many beautiful invitations are let down by boring unco-ordinating envelopes that leave them feeling unfinished.
				Our co-ordinating envelopes are just one of the many things that your guests won't be able to stop looking at.
			</p>


		<article class="centred phablet_width_80 width_50 tablet_width_70 padding_bottom_large mob_width_95">
			<p class="font_big junge centred">
				Inside, you'll find your wedding invitation protected by layers of tissue paper, light as a feather and again printed and watermarked with your design.
			</p>

			<p class="padding_bottom_large">As well as adding an angelic beauty, it will make your guests feel like they're opening a box containing an expensive of designer shoes rather than just pulling a card from an envelope.</p>

			<%- include("partials/html_chloe_testimonial") %>

				<p>The next step will see your guests removing one of a range of embellishments which add that wow factor:</p>

				<p class="junge font_big centred">
					Whether it's uwrapping the paper sleeve adorned with your monogram, unbuckling the gently glinting diamante ribbon or untying the bow, it all adds to the excitement.
				</p>

				<p>A delicate vellum cover, semi-transparent like a pane of frosted glass, softly mutes your card like a halo: as it falls away, your chosen colours&mdash;printed in solid wax that feels slightly raised as you run your finger over it&mdash;will seem
					even deeper and bolder.</p>

				<p>And the card itself, available in a variety of textures, creates a tactile satisfaction as it reveals the details of your important ceremony. </p>


				<p class="centred junge font_big">
					These are just a few of the little details that make our invitations&mdash; <span class="slant">your invitations</span>&mdash;a cut above the rest.
				</p>

				<p class="centred junge font_big">
					And it's in the little details that the big impressions get made.
				</p>

				<p>But don't take my word for it.</p>

				<p class="padding_bottom_large">if you haven't already ordered your free wedding invitation sample box, don't miss the opportunity to do so now and you judge for yourself.</p>
