	The journey from postbox to letterbox is fraught with dangers</h2>

	<p class="body">Ever wondered what happens to your invitations when they go in the post box?</p>

	<p class="body">Does a magic fairy with clean hands magically fly them to their destination?</p>

	<p class="body">No.</p>

	<p class="body">They are handled by at least a dozen different people, pressed between rollers, rained-upon and X-rayed&mdash;just for starters. </p>

	<p class="body">All of this means that there without careful consideration, your invitation may well not arrive in the same state you posted it in. </p>

	<p class="body">One bride was devastated to find that when her guests received her invitation, the ink had transferred to the other side of the card, causing a horrible, smudged, ghosting effect. </p>

	<h2 class="width_66 subhead font_d">Another common issue is Fat Envelope Syndrome&hellip;</h2>



	<p class="body">...standard envelopes aren't designed to take invitations with a ribbon or an embellishment such as a diamante. They are meant for flat cards only.</p>

	<ul class="sans average_line_spacing font_ee half_padding_vertical">

		<li>Added extras will give the envelope a horrible, unsightly bulge,</li>

		<li>you won't be able to seal them neatly</li>

		<li>and to top it off when they are in the post, the knot on the ribbon or the envelope will often get pushed against the envelope so hard that it will actually cause the envelope to rip and can end up poking through.</li>

	</ul>



	<p class="body">Gems and buckles can press against other enclosures as well as the envelope causing unsightly scars and indents. </p>


	<p class="body clear">Rain will often cause handwritten addresses to run if you use soluble ink, and the same can go for ink printed with inkjets. </p>

		<p class="body">
			We do checks every step of the way to avoid these sort of issues, and if we notice something that doesn't seem right, we won't just blindly go ahead with your order&mdash;we'll contact you to check it out.</p>

		<p class="body">
			Honestly, the number of times I see Michael spelled Micheal&mdash;it'd be easy to just go ahead without questioning it, but I always contact the bride to double-check and usually I get "Yes, it should be Michael! THANK YOU for noticing!". </p>

			A lot of stationery companies allow you to customise designs yourself online&mdash;this is great fun but in practice we've learned that for items as complex and important as wedding stationery it only leads to misery: there are too many opportunities

		 Personalisation will save you many hours of valuable time and stress…
	</h2>

		<p class="body">Have you any idea how long it takes to individually address each invitation and envelope?</p>

		<p class="body">It's probably something you haven't thought too hard about, but handwriting guest names on each invitation is a messy, time consuming , physically demanding and error prone business&hellip;</p>

		<p class="body">Your hand will ache after a while and the beautiful handwriting you inscribed on the first invitation will start looking like a Doctor's signature by invitation number 32.</p>

		<p class="body">And there's no delete button when you mess up the spelling, and oh dear, now your invitation is ruined as the name won't fit in the space!</p>

		<p class="body">If you're going to personalise your invitations by hand, then you need to be prepared to order a good few extra envelopes and invitations as you're going to screw up some of them. It's a fact. </p>



										<div class="width_66 centred caption" style="clear:both;"id="caption_vellum_cover">

										<img src="/images/homepage/pointer_up.svg" class="pointer"/><br/>
										A semi-transparent cover, made from vellum and delicately watermarked with your design and monogram, surrounds your invitation, both protecting it and adding to the tactile experience for your guests: its translucent quality softly mutes the design beneath like a veil of frosted glass, giving your invitations an atmosphere of otherworldly magic.
										</div>

		<p class="body">Plus, ink smudges easily, and in the words of one of our brides, "I just don't like the look of a perfect printed invitation and then hand written names".</p>

		<p class="body">But there's a simple solution:</p>

		<p class="body">We can print your guest names on each invitation individually, as well as addressing your envelopes (more info below):</p>


		<p class="body">not only does it look much nicer to have an invitation co-ordinated with pre-printed names in a matching font, but creating a list you can edit and update on a computer first is much more sensible:</p>

		<p class="body">You can thorougly check for mistakes, and, if you intend to handwrite your envelopes you're going to have to create a list of names and addresses anyway&hellip;</p>

		<p class="body">&hellip;so why, when you've already created the list, double the amount of time and effort by rewriting these all out when they can just be emailed to us for printing?</p>

		<p class="body">But it's about more than just saving time&hellip;</p>

		<p class="body">Personalisation is extremely important because by explicitly addressing your invitations to "Sarah, Jane & Jenny", it takes the guesswork away from your guests:</p>

		<p class="body">Sarah knows straight away that she can bring her flatmate and daughter. If it just says "Sarah & Guest", she knows she is invited and can bring any guest.</p>


		<p class="body">An invitation that isn't personalised makes it awkward for your guests to know who they can and can't bring along (and awkward for you to know who they are bringing along too), but if you address your guests individually, you'll make things easier for yourself and your guests from the start: it avoids that difficult conversation when they ask you, "Can I bring the kids/boyfriend I met last week?".</p>

		<p class="body last">If you don't personalise your wedding invitations with individual names, it's not clear who exactly is invited--and that means more hassle for you.</p>

			There's a reason people hire graphic designers…</p>

			…sometimes when you look at something, it just looks professional, chic and expensive but if anyone was to ask you, you wouldn't be able to explain why--it's just a feeling.</p>

		<p class="body">
			But a lot of work goes into making you have that feeling: it's all in the detail-- care and attention to the little nuances that, on their own don't seem very significant but combined make a massive difference to the way people see and perceive your invitations--either
			as cheap and tacky or expensive and elegant.</p>

		<p class="body">Subtle touches such as careful alignment and spacing, the use of bullet points and ornamental separations between paragraphs are just some of the things that individually may not sound like much but together add up to create a stunning layout that you
			would expect from a Royal wedding.</p>


		<p class="body">Stuff from Lidl looks and feels cheaper than the premium products at Waitrose. </p>

		<p class="body"> Free fonts and clipart that have been downloaded from the internet are free for a reason: they don't have the same refinements that will give your invitations a polished, superior look.</p>

			It's important for your invitations to look good: there's no doubt about that.</p>

			to make planning your wedding easier and therefore less stressful for you.
		</p>

		<p class="body">
			To do that, you need to think of all the possible questions your guests are going to have and try to answer them in the content of your invitation.
		</p>

		<p class="body">
			You're also going to need to figure out what information you're going to need back from them to help you plan your wedding, such as simple RSVPs for guest numbers and things like menu choices.
		</p>

		<p class="body">
			Your guests are human, and like most humans, they're more likely to do something if it's easy and pain-free, so you also need to make it as easy as possible for them to reply.

			A pre-addressed reply card increases your chances of getting responses quickly as it is very easy for your guests to just tick a box or two and post the card.
		</p>

		<p class="body">
			We even print your guest names on the reply cards to make it even easier for them (and more accurate for you&mdash;leave it to your guests and believe me they won't even remember to write their own name so you won't know who the reply card is from!).
		</p>

		<p class="body">
			No reply cards means no replies: and no replies means, among the other 101 things you need to do, you're going to have the hassle of chasing your guests to find out who is, or isn't, coming.
		</p>

		<p class="body">
			In our experience, invitations with reply cards get around three times as many responses as invitations without!
		</p>

		<p class="body">
			You'll find the number of details you provide about your wedding day is inversely proportional to the stress you'll experience (the more details you give, less stress for you!).
		</p>

		<p class="body">
			That's why providing an additional instruction leaflet for all the extra stuff can really make your life easierso guests don't have to hassle you with questions at the last minute:
		</p>

		<p class="body">
			Where exactly is the venue?
		</p>

		<p class="body">
			A simple map can save you and your bridesmaids dealing with the exasperation of answering twenty phone calls on the morning of your wedding as lost guests phone you when they've gone up the wrong country lane.
		</p>

		<p class="body">
			What do they wear?
		</p>

		<p class="body">
			Explaining the dress code is important if you don't want Auntie Edna turning up in that bright puce dress with the ostentatious hat.
		</p>

		<p class="body">
			Can children come?
		</p>

		<p class="body">
			Can they give vouchers or money instead of buying you another garlic press?
		</p>

		<p class="body">
			It's monotonous and rage-inducing to keep hearing the same questions again and again: avoid the bitterness by answering questions in advance with a comprehensive information enclosure.
