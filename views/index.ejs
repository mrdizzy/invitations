																					The journey from postbox to letterbox is fraught with dangers</h2>

				<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">No.</p>


				<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">They are handled by at least a dozen different people, pressed between rollers, rained-upon and X-rayed&mdash;just for starters. </p>


				<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">All of this means that there without careful consideration, your invitation may well not arrive in the same state you posted it in. </p>


				<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">One bride was devastated to find that when her guests received her invitation, the ink had transferred to the other side of the card, causing a horrible, smudged, ghosting effect. </p>


				<h2 class="width_66 average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical text_center font_d blocked_and_centred sans_subhead">Another common issue is Fat Envelope Syndrome&hellip;</h2>


				<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">&hellip;standard envelopes aren't designed to take invitations with a ribbon or an embellishment such as a diamante. They are meant for flat cards only.</p>


				<ul class="sans average_line_spacing font_ee half_padding_vertical">
				<li>Added extras will give the envelope a horrible, unsightly bulge,</li>
					<li>you won't be able to seal them neatly</li>
					<li>and to top it off when they are in the post, the knot on the ribbon or the envelope will often get pushed against the envelope so hard that it will
					actually cause the envelope to rip and can end up poking through.</li>
				</ul>


				<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">Gems and buckles can press against other enclosures as well as the envelope causing unsightly scars and indents. </p>

											Murphy's Law: Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong&hellip;
</h2>
		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">Spelling errors.</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">Delays in delivery.</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">Colours not matching.</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">Things not looking how you thought they would, after everything's been printed&hellip; </p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">The road from placing an order to receiving your finished invitations can be bumpy if you're not working with people who communicate well and know all the issues that can, and will, arise. </p>

		<h2 class="width_80 average_line_spacing blocked_and_centred half_padding_vertical text_center font_d sans_subhead">In a world where so much is automated, potential problems can fall through the cracks as there is no human being involved to stop and intervene:</h2>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			For example, one bride had uploaded her list of addresses to a stationery company but there was a limit to 5 lines per address: therefore some of the addresses had the last two lines cut off!</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			But she only found out when she received her invitations&mdash;if the company had bothered to do a few checks, they could easily have flagged this up and sorted out the problem before it was too late.</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			We do checks every step of the way to avoid these sort of issues, and if we notice something that doesn't seem right, we won't just blindly go ahead with your order&mdash;we'll contact you to check it out.</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			Honestly, the number of times I see Michael spelled Micheal&mdash;it'd be easy to just go ahead without questioning it, but I always contact the bride to double-check and usually I get "Yes, it should be Michael! THANK YOU for noticing!". </p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			A lot of stationery companies allow you to customise designs yourself online&mdash;this is great fun but in practice we've learned that for items as complex and important as wedding stationery it only leads to misery: there are too many opportunities
			for errors and mistakes.</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			Until technology gets really intelligent, it's still really important that a human being is involved in each step.</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			I know how important it is for you to be kept informed as to what's going on. I won't hide problems from you&mdash;I'll tell you straight away so you can make informed decisions.</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			If you (or I!) have the slightest concerns about how your invitation is going to look in the flesh (colours on screen never look the same as on card, for example), I'll send you a print of every item in your suite in the post before printing goes ahead
			so you can be 100% confident. </p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing sans half_padding_vertical">
			If the paper you want isn't in stock, we'll tell you as soon as you place your order and I'll be honest about how long it will take to get it back in stock so you can make an informed decision rather than taking your money and then apologising for "unexpected
			delays" later down the line.

			Coordination.
		</p>
		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			It's a long word, and it's the Holy Grail of design. </p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			You hold a beautiful invitation in your hand: the colours compliment one another, the typefaces are perfectly in tune with the tone of the wedding, and then you see it&hellip;</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			&hellip; a fuzzy map that's been cut and pasted from Google Maps. </p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			a ribbon which is slightly off colour to everything else&hellip;</p>


		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			Or an envelope made from a different textured paper to the invitations. </p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			One little thing can let the whole team down!</p>


			<h2 class="width_66 text_center blocked_and_centred font_d sans_subhead half_padding_vertical average_line_spacing">
					It's like the fly in the Chardonnay and it spoils everything.</h2>
		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			To make a striking impression, every item of your stationery should match perfectly, just like an outfit.</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			Co-ordination is important because it shows care and attention to detail precisely because it takes more work and effort to make things compliment one another.
		</p>
		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			Poor co-ordination shows thoughtlessness and neglect. </p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing last half_padding_vertical sans">
			That's why every item in our stationery suite works in careful harmony with its siblings, from the ribbon, to the professionally tailored maps, to the tissue paper. Everything is beautifull co-ordinated to match, from the Save The Date cards to the Order
			of Service. </p>

Personalisation will save you many hours of valuable time and stressâ¦
														</h2>
		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			Have you any idea how long it takes to individually address each invitation and envelope?
		</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">It's probably something you haven't thought too hard about, but handwriting guest names on each invitation is a messy, time consuming , physically demanding and error prone business&hellip;</p>


		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">Your hand will ache after a while and the beautiful handwriting you inscribed on the first invitation will start looking like a Doctor's signature by invitation number 32.</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">And there's no delete button when you mess up the spelling, and oh dear, now your invitation is ruined as the name won't fit in the space!</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">If you're going to personalise your invitations by hand, then you need to be prepared to order a good few extra envelopes and invitations as you're going to screw up some of them. It's a fact. </p>

		<img src="/images/homepage/big_illustrations/guestname.png" style="margin:0 auto;width:250px;display:block;" />

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">Plus, ink smudges easily, and in the words of one of our brides, "I just don't like the look of a perfect printed invitation and then hand written names".</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">But there's a simple solution:</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">We can print your guest names on each invitation individually, as well as addressing your envelopes (more info below):</p>

		<img src="/images/homepage/big_illustrations/guestaddress.png" class="image_100" style="margin:0 auto;padding-top:1em;padding-bottom:1em;display:block;" />
		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">not only does it look much nicer to have an invitation co-ordinated with pre-printed names in a matching font, but creating a list you can edit and update on a computer first is much more sensible:</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">You can thorougly check for mistakes, and, if you intend to handwrite your envelopes you're going to have to create a list of names and addresses anyway&hellip;

		</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">&hellip;so why, when you've already created the list, double the amount of time and effort by rewriting these all out when they can just be emailed to us for printing?</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">But it's about more than just saving time&hellip;</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">Personalisation is extremely important because by explicitly addressing your invitations to "Sarah, Jane & Jenny", it takes the guesswork away from your guests:</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">Sarah knows straight away that she can bring her flatmate and daughter. If it just says "Sarah & Guest", she knows she is invited and can bring any guest.</p>

		<img src="/images/homepage/big_illustrations/monograms.png" class="image_100" style="display:block;margin:0 auto;" />
		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">An invitation that isn't personalised makes it awkward for your guests to know who they can and can't bring along (and awkward for you to know who they are bringing along too), but if you address your guests individually, you'll make things easier for
			yourself and your guests from the start: it avoids that difficult conversation when they ask you, "Can I bring the kids/boyfriend I met last week?".</p>

		<p class="font_ee sans half_padding_vertical average_line_spacing last">If you don't personalise your wedding invitations with individual names, it's not clear who exactly is invited--and that means more hassle for you.</p>

																			Don't let your invitation look like a card from Moonpig&hellip;

																		</h2>
		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">

			Whatever you do, please, please don't let your invitation look like it was created in Microsoft Word.
		</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			Nothing shouts cheap and amateur louder and looks uglier than an invitation that's been laid out by someone with no typography skills. </p>
		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			There's a reason people hire graphic designersâ¦</p>
		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			â¦sometimes when you look at something, it just looks professional, chic and expensive but if anyone was to ask you, you wouldn't be able to explain why--it's just a feeling.</p>


		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			But a lot of work goes into making you have that feeling: it's all in the detail-- care and attention to the little nuances that, on their own don't seem very significant but combined make a massive difference to the way people see and perceive your invitations--either
			as cheap and tacky or expensive and elegant.</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">Subtle touches such as careful alignment and spacing, the use of bullet points and ornamental separations between paragraphs are just some of the things that individually may not sound like much but together add up to create a stunning layout that you
			would expect from a Royal wedding.</p>


		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">Stuff from Lidl looks and feels cheaper than the premium products at Waitrose. </p>

		<h2 class="width_80 sans_subhead half_padding_vertical average_line_spacing blocked_and_centred text_center font_d">The Sun newspaper looks tackier and less classy than The Times. </h2>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">But whilst you can see the difference, it takes a professional to understand what goes into making the difference. </p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans"> Free fonts and clipart that have been downloaded from the internet are free for a reason: they don't have the same refinements that will give your invitations a polished, superior look.</p>

		<img src="/images/homepage/big_illustrations/invitetext.png" class="image_100" style="display:block;margin:0 auto;" />


		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			Some of the fonts we use have cost hundreds of pounds, and we pay that because we know the time and effort went into creating them and the value they give in making your invitations look exquisite. </p>
		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			Too many stationery suppliers are often brides with no design background who've created their own stationery and decided to make a bit of money on the side creating stationery for others. </p>
		<p class="font_ee half_padding_vertical sans average_line_spacing last">
			Which leads me nicely onto...</p>

												Substance is as important as style&hellip;
			 </h2>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			It's important for your invitations to look good: there's no doubt about that.</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			But it's only half the battle: caught up in the delight of making sure everything looks perfect, it's very easy to forget that invitations serve a practical function too: to inform and educate your guests as much as possible about the event, and in turn,
			to make planning your wedding easier and therefore less stressful for you.
		</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			To do that, you need to think of all the possible questions your guests are going to have and try to answer them in the content of your invitation.
		</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			You're also going to need to figure out what information you're going to need back from them to help you plan your wedding, such as simple RSVPs for guest numbers and things like menu choices.
		</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			Your guests are human, and like most humans, they're more likely to do something if it's easy and pain-free, so you also need to make it as easy as possible for them to reply.
		</p>

		<p class="font_d average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans_subhead blocked_and_centred text_center">
			That's why those little extras, such as information enclosures and reply cards are important.
		</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			A pre-addressed reply card increases your chances of getting responses quickly as it is very easy for your guests to just tick a box or two and post the card.
		</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			We even print your guest names on the reply cards to make it even easier for them (and more accurate for you&mdash;leave it to your guests and believe me they won't even remember to write their own name so you won't know who the reply card is from!).
		</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			No reply cards means no replies: and no replies means, among the other 101 things you need to do, you're going to have the hassle of chasing your guests to find out who is, or isn't, coming.
		</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			In our experience, invitations with reply cards get around three times as many responses as invitations without!
		</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			You'll find the number of details you provide about your wedding day is inversely proportional to the stress you'll experience (the more details you give, less stress for you!).
		</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			That's why providing an additional instruction leaflet for all the extra stuff can really make your life easierso guests don't have to hassle you with questions at the last minute:
		</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			Where exactly is the venue?
		</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			A simple map can save you and your bridesmaids dealing with the exasperation of answering twenty phone calls on the morning of your wedding as lost guests phone you when they've gone up the wrong country lane.
		</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			What do they wear?
		</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			Explaining the dress code is important if you don't want Auntie Edna turning up in that bright puce dress with the ostentatious hat.
		</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			Can children come?
		</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			Can they give vouchers or money instead of buying you another garlic press?
		</p>

		<p class="font_ee average_line_spacing half_padding_vertical sans">
			It's monotonous and rage-inducing to keep hearing the same questions again and again: avoid the bitterness by answering questions in advance with a comprehensive information enclosure.
